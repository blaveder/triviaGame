# Trivia Game

This is my first **Trivia Game**. It will display a button at the beginning of the game. Once the **user** pushes *start* the game will begin.  Questions will be displayed one at a time on the screen. The **user** has a limited amount of time to play the game based on random facts about **The Big Lebowski**. If the **user** selects the correct answer a screen pops up saying correct and then a new question appears on the window. If the **user** gets it wrong same thing will happen displaying the correct answer.

Once the game is over, the window will display which ones were right, which ones were wrong and a button if the **user** wishes to play agian.
